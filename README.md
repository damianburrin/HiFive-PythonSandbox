**CONTEXT**

In 2019 i was lucky enough to be approached by the BBC to help support the development of the HiFive Inventor.  The purpose of this board was meant as a fully supported coding tutorial environment using both block based and python based programming, all supported by the awesome guys at Tynker.  I worked on testing the development through many iterations until the boards final release and I was even able to get some of my Y7 students (who were the target age group) so early version that they could try out in the real world and they loved them.

The development and launch was hit by covid but the board eventually went on sale in 2020.  The Dr Who these and learning materials were really go an

The board was a ARM based board developed by SiFive and was made to be similar in format to the BBC Micro:bit, but this board had the additional features of built in ESP32 wifi chip making it a true IOT device.

In 2024 some of my students who were still activly using the boards reported that the Tynker website (hifiveinventor.com) was no longer there - I reached out to Tynker who responded that the project was only short term and had run its course so they no longer supported the device.  I tried contacting the BBC team but had no reply.

So this left us in a difficult position - all through the development process I was championing the idea of a sandbox environment.  What would students do once they'd finished the tutorials?  The boards were so powerful compared to the standard Micro:bit that it would be a shame if there was no ongoing support.  The coding environement for python and block did allow you to sandbox and create your own programs but you were locked into having a Tynker account and the environemnt was quite restrictive.  Now that had gone these boards are useless.


**June 2024**

Having been bagered by one of my awesome students (JS) now a year 10 and in my GCSE group who wanted to do more with his board I began to look back at my resources from the development and realised I probably have enough stuff to enable people to keep using these boards in python

**Resources**
The resources here are no fully tested, they certainly have no wararanty and may kill your board (doubtful) but as it no use to yopu anyway aznd is just a Â£70 paper weight what have you got to lose?

**COPYRIGHT**
Some of the resources I have collated here are in my opinion open source.  The Mu Environement for example is open source so the addtions made by the development to this should fall into it's open source remit
Some of the resources here a clearly copyright for the development teams whether these are MicroPython based or not and if asked by the developers i will remove these.  I will also email the contacts i still have to say these are online and if there is an issue I will remove them.  My goal here is to give you back a working device.  Which at the moment, despite buying these in good faith you no longer have.

The following names are people who I recall working on this project under the direction of Kara Iconis at the BBC and are credtited with the work i'm hosting here.
